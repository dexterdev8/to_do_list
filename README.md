## Timeline:

December 30 2021: Setup Rust env, Near-cli and testnet account

December 31 2021: Research on Rust and the near-sdk

January 01 2022: Having some fun :)

January 03 2022: Implementing the Smart Contract + unit tests and playing with the calls

January 07 2022: Fixing a unit test and introducing upgradability

January 08 2022: Making the contract upgradable using the different methods described on the doc (subaccounts, migration method and enums, this last one didn't go that well...)

## To sum up:

I really enjoied playing aroung with the near-sdk and doing my research on what are the best practices. Of course there is plenty of room for improvement but I am happy with the result so far. I have the feeling that after a review from you guys I can do some optimizations on the code.

Small concern from my side: the events.
I followed an example form the Near doc and by now, the result looks fine in the block explorer but I have the feeling that it can be done in a better way. I hope you can give me some detailed feedback regarding this.

Why making the contract upgradeable?
Probably I should have sticked to the PDF requirements but I had a lot of free time this week :)

### Note to myself:

Once I've deployed the V2 contract, I had to make a small change in the code. In order to deploy again I used:

`near deploy --accountId to-do-tasks.dexterdev8.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/to_do_contract.wasm`

Since I did don change the structure of the data it made no sense to migrate again. After testing seems to work fine.
